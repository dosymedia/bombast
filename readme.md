# Bombast
A PHP forum built for play-by-post roleplaying games (known as PBP RPGs or forum-based RPs). This is a side-project to learn PHP & Laravel on. At this point in time, functionality is more important than elegance. When the basics are mastered and proper solutions have been drawn out, the first iteration (proper) iteration of this project will be completed. 

Until then, you're free to offer suggestions, gawk, or laugh from afar.
