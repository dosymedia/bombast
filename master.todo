Considerations --- ✄ -----------------------:
	should the profile page be at; 
		user/profile/4138908
		user/482
		user/terri
		user/teddy-rose

* users sign in with email instead of username to eliminate the need
for a username field, thus shifting user_display to user_name
subaccounts -
	parent id can be equal to id 
	parent id can be equal to null


Accounts --- ✄ -----------------------:
Accounts 				Password
	admin 					cahuna

	seraphim				blackhalo
	admin 					cahuna
	thedoctor 			tardis
	cakehole 				metallica
